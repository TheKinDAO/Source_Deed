# Source_Deed
Each Source_Deed is implemented as 2 very distinct parts:
1. *legal code* documenting the transfer of ownership of a Source_Title.
2. *source code* usually as a Smart Contracts.

The *legal code* is a digitally-signed document of a legally-binding property deed (or other variations as defined by local jurusdiction).

The *legal code* of each Source_Deed **must** reference a Source_Title recording the previous owner and a Source_Title recording the next owner.

In this way, each Source_Deed always references 2 Source_Titles, and each Source_Title references at least one Source_Deed.

For example: Source_Title1 <- Source_Deed1 -> Source_Title2 <- Source_Deed2 -> Source_Title3 (current owner)
